# Grabify IP Blocklist

IP Grabbers such as grabify are generally harmless, however they can be used to intimidate less tech savvy users.
This can easily be prevented by using a blocklist.

This blocklist should work with any DNS sinkhole like Pi-Hole and Adguard Home

## How to Install
To install this blocklist, simply add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EsadCetiner/Grabify-Blocklist/main/blocklist.txt inside your Pi-Hole/Adguard Home.
